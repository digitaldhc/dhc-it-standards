# Physical infrastructure standards (datacentre and on-prem)

Physical infrastructure refers to compute and networking devices that are deployed to non-cloud locations, for example to a datacentre or another physical location.

## Location

The Trust has a preferred set of datacentres that MUST be used above any other location for physical IT hardware. Contact andrew.harrison11@nhs.net for details.

Physical IT infrastructure MUST NOT be installed into any other location than approved datacentres.

Specifically, general office locations are not suitable for the deployment of IT infrastructure other than required local networking. 
The installation of servers to office locations other than those required for good running of the IM&T service will not be approved.

## Data-Centres

The only datacentres approved for Trust IT infrastructure are those owned and operated by the Trust, or those that are secured to HM government standards where:

* access to the site is controlled by 24hr guards;
* installed equipment is isolated from other organisations;
* sufficient HVAC and fire suppression is available;
* access is limited to a pre-approved list of security cleared personnel.

The Trust handles multiple classifications of data and all data-centres must assume that they will be required to handle classified data at multiple levels.

## Communications Equipment Rooms

Dorset HealthCare sites have designated CERs for the deployment of communications equipment. These primarily consist of:

* one or more lockable 19" racks;
* sufficient power and air-conditioning (HVAC) for the size of room and amount of equipment deployed.

Ideally, the room should:

* Be locked and only accessible by pre-approved personnel.
* Have a process for allowing pre-approved and logged access from vendors (e.g. BT for telecoms).
* Have a filtered air-conditioning unit to prevent the build-up of dust and debris in expensive communications equipment.
* Be only used for communications equipment and not used for storage, printing or other high-footfall purposes.

It should be noted that the racks, air-conditioning, electrical power supplies may all constitute health and safety risks in addition to the security and privacy risks created by allowing untrained, unapproved staff access. New CERs should only be developed in accordance with published standards.
