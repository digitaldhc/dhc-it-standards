# Dorset HealthCare IT standards

Welcome to the [Dorset HealthCare](https://www.dorsethealthcare.nhs.uk/) IT standards internet homepage. These standards are written in Markdown and managed as code, and inspired by a similar set of standards in use at [NHS England](https://github.com/nhsengland/it-standards).
