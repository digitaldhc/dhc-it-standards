# Identity and access management

Identity and access management is broken down into three main areas due to the numerous authentication providers in use within the organisation.

## Internal - dhc.nhs.uk
The strategic tool providing identities for internal use is the Dorset HealthCare *Azure Active Directory* or AAD. Each individual with an employment contract, as well as many contractors, secondees and agency staff should have an entry in the Dorset HealthCare AAD.

The Dorset HealthCare Azure Active Directory is populated from an on-premise Active Directory. Identities in these directories end with the suffix @dhc.nhs.uk.

## External - nhs.net
The NHSmail Azure Active Directory (AAD) is another strategic identity provider. Each individual with a NHSmail mailbox will have an entry in the NHSmail AAD.
