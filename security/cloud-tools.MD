# Cloud applications and services guidance

This page provides general guidance for staff on the use of internet or cloud based software, services and web tools.

This guidance is based on material originally developed by the [Ministry of Justice](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance/) and [NHS England](https://nhsengland.github.io/it-standards/#/security/acceptable-cloud-tools), and is adapted for use at Dorset HealthCare.

## Overview

There are a great many innovative and easy to use tools, systems and services available on the internet, often for free or for an affordable price. This page tells you about the tools you can and cannot use for official purposes. This guidance applies to all staff who work for Dorset HealthCare or use Dorset HealthCare devices.

## Corporate collaboration tools

These are the preferred tools for collaborating with colleagues and external partners, and should always be used by preference.
